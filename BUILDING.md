# Building

To build the core and example JAR's, first clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/alexholmes/htuple

Then simply go into the `htuple` directory and run Maven:

    $ mvn package

After this is complete you'll have both core and example JAR's:

    $ ls core/target/* examples/target/*
